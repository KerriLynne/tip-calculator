# Bill Buddy

This application was created to be at your fingertips anytime you are dining either at home or out! It's an easy and quick way to roll up a total for your meal including the % tip you would like to give and the amount of people that are splitting the bill. Once totalled correctly you are able to save to either a delivery category or a dining in category to keep track of your food spending!
